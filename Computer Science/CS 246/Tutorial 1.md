## January 3, 2018

Welcome to tutorial 1! (This surprisingly happened even before the first day of classes)

CS 246 Content is in git so we have to use some commands of git which will be explained as we go through the course.

The linux environement is preffered to work wwith and hence it is recommended. All the data has been made available from the linux student server so we can login in to the server as follows:
```bash
ssh username@linux.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca
Enter your passowrd for this account. 
```
You can change your linux.student.cs password at this website if you do not have any cle what it was from CS 136.

The above method is for the people using following environments:
1. Linux
1. Mac
1. Bash on Ubuntu on Windows (Only for Windows 10 Creators Update)

To setup Bash on Ubuntu on Windows, click here [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about)

Otherwise, we can download the Putty client which is a free .exe client. or Downlaod super putty.

CS 246 and old directory
A0 has been posted piazza (for this term please look into piazza for hints to where A0 might be in your term) and as a note one should start the assignments quite early.
